- Cubic Spline Interpolation
- Discrete Fourier Transform (Find the time complexity too)
- Fast Fourier Transform (Find the time complexity too)
- Linear System of Equation   
- Write a Doolittle LU (Lower-Upper) algorithm for Linear System
    Use the algorithm to solve
    x1 - x2 + 3x3 + 2x4 = 15
    x1 + 5x2 - 5x3 - 2x4 = -35
    3x1 - 5x2 + 19x3 + 3x4 = 94
    2x1 - 2x2 + 3x3 + 21x4 = 1
